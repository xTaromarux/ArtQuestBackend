"44c92ac4-ced2-41c5-ac20-46ca8bbe0745","Lines","Master the art of drawing lines.","Lines are the foundation of every drawing, and mastering their creation is the first step toward becoming an artist. In this path, you'll learn how to control lines to make them straight, precise, and expressive. You'll discover how different types of lines—straight, curved, broken—can impact the message and aesthetics of a drawing. Lines are not just contours of objects; they are a way to create dynamics, texture, and depth in your artwork. Mastering this technique opens the door to more advanced stages of creation, such as shading and perspective.","Through this path, you will learn how to use lines to shape the world on paper. Each exercise is designed to improve your control over your tools, helping you to accurately replicate details and develop your unique artistic style. You’ll also learn how lines can convey emotions and energy—from soft, delicate lines symbolizing calmness to dynamic, sharp lines that add drama. By the end of this path, lines will no longer be just a tool but your means of storytelling.",500,200,"568460e5-07f4-4129-a997-71d535ea943f","0c7476fa-09a1-4f55-9040-f1668890cfab"
"b8aaeeb5-1a86-46ec-ab18-9c1028d78721","Light and Shading","Bring art to life with light.","Light and shadow bring drawings to life, making them three-dimensional and realistic. In this path, you’ll learn to identify light sources and apply appropriate shading techniques to emphasize the form and texture of objects. You’ll explore how light interacts with different materials, such as metal, glass, or wood, and how to create smooth transitions between light and dark areas.","Through the exercises in this path, you’ll learn to control the intensity of light and use shadows to add depth and emotional resonance to your work. You’ll understand how shadows cast by objects can enrich the composition and create dramatic effects. Mastering light and shadow is a step toward more advanced drawings and highly detailed works.",700,400,"9adfd27c-1e0e-473d-8bb0-4bad11e8eb26","5d429a83-c71d-416f-8a66-c0cebad05481"
"cd66f93f-c42b-44c4-ab29-6532a796ac13","3D Vision","Add depth to your drawings.","3D vision is the ability to add depth to your drawings, making them look realistic. In this path, you’ll learn techniques such as layering, scaling objects, and using perspective to create the illusion of a third dimension. You'll also learn how distance, arrangement, and light influence the perception of depth.","This path will help you transition from flat drawings to more realistic images. You’ll discover how shadows and light affect perception and how to draw objects that seem to leap off the page. You'll build the illusion of depth using simple techniques accessible to beginners.",600,300,"923c7829-8f1d-44fd-84d3-f5d9698c5b58","5fdd4e63-c481-4439-b27c-56e938ec30ea"
"e318020c-38f2-41cb-960f-6b0e57725114","Perspective","Create depth and space.","Perspective is a crucial skill that allows you to create drawings with realistic depth and proportions. In this path, you’ll learn the principles of one-point, two-point, and multi-point perspective, as well as how to use guiding lines and vanishing points to represent three-dimensional space on a flat surface. With perspective, your drawings will become more dynamic and convincing.","Learning perspective will help you better understand the proportions of objects and their relationships in space. You’ll discover how to draw landscapes, interiors, and architecture while incorporating depth. Mastering perspective is not only the foundation of realistic drawing but also a tool for creating more complex and creative compositions.",800,500,"a6f7089a-1009-489b-83ac-2821a5e0f9f7","87ea505e-2af9-4477-aaab-9eb4e282e2c1"
"f425606e-3c63-43b3-8cb7-85bfe869369b","Basic Shapes","Build with simple shapes.","Basic shapes are the key to understanding how complex forms are created. In this path, you'll focus on drawing circles, squares, rectangles, and triangles, which form the foundation of most objects. You'll learn to see the geometric basis of the surrounding world, making it easier to replicate reality. With precise exercises, you'll develop observational skills and learn proportions, symmetry, and harmony in drawing.","During this path, you’ll progress from simple shapes to more complex compositions. Every object in reality can be broken down into geometric shapes, making it easier to understand and draw. For example, the human body can be simplified into oval shapes, while buildings can be reduced to rectangles. This path will teach you how to combine and manipulate shapes to create three-dimensional objects.",400,100,"043539d9-9be3-4960-8dff-aef431d0c5a9","29baa5e8-34bd-40bc-b61a-181f333f5982"
